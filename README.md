A concurrency library for Gleam!

# NOTE: This is currently broken. It is accepting feedback and assistance, but several functions are unusable.
(The tests are passing, to give you a sense of which parts of it work :)

## Quick start

```sh
gleam run   # Run the project
gleam test  # Run the tests
gleam shell # Run an Erlang shell
```

## Installation

This package can be added to your Gleam project:

```sh
gleam add glimmer
```

and its documentation can be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/glimmer>.
